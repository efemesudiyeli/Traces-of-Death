  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: Another day, another soul to claim.
    - person: Reaper
      line: But today feels different; there's an air of mystery, a lingering question
        in the universe.
    - person: Reaper
      line: For even Death itself cannot resist the allure of a mystery.
  - lines:
    - person: GOD
      line: My child, it is good to see you here one more.
    - person: GOD
      line: I know you take pleasure not only in fulfilling the toll of death but
        also in unraveling mysteries of murder.
    - person: GOD
      line: So I present you with three different doors.
    - person: GOD
      line: Behind the first door, the first murder awaits you. Another soul awaits
        in the mortal realm.
    - person: GOD
      line: Proceed, Reaper, knowing that unraveling the mysteries behind murder
        is inherent to your being.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: I hate portals.
    - person: Reaper
      line: Another scene of chaos. What story does this shattered room hold?
    - person: Reaper
      line: The brushstrokes of fate are as unpredictable as ever.
    - person: Reaper
      line: I wonder who is the killer. I should check all the evidences of this
        murder then I should take the soul of this man.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: I wrote all of the evidences on my whiteboard.
  - lines:
    - person: GOD
      line: You have successfully gathered the evidence from the first murder. However,
        this is just the beginning.
    - person: GOD
      line: Behind the second gate awaits another mystery for you to unravel. Proceed
        with caution and maintain balance.
    - person: GOD
      line: Go for the second door.
    - person: Reaper
      line: Thank you, my lord.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: Well, what do we have here?
    - person: Reaper
      line: A slain priest, a sanctum tainted with violence. The fabric of life torn
        asunder once more.
    - person: Reaper
      line: Who would dare to extinguish the light of the divine? The whispers of
        the departed grow louder, urging me to seek justice amidst the shadows.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: The pattern emerges, the threads of fate intertwine. Two murders, seemingly
        unrelated, now reveal a common thread.
    - person: Reaper
      line: The probability leans heavily towards a shared hand behind these veils
        of mortality.
    - person: Reaper
      line: It's time to see if the next gate holds the key to this enigma.
  - lines:
    - person: GOD
      line: "Reaper, do you ever find yourself weary of this eternal cycle? The constant
        dance between life and death, the unraveling of mysteries \u2014 does it
        ever weigh upon you?"
    - person: Reaper
      line: My Lord, the passage of time may be eternal, but the intricacies of mortality
        keep me engaged. Each soul, each mystery, holds its own story waiting to
        be unraveled. While the weight of existence can be felt, the pursuit of truth
        amidst the chaos fuels my purpose.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: This place... I've seen it before. In that photograph that I found at
        previous door.
    - person: Reaper
      line: 'A place where warmth and comfort should reign, now tainted with the
        shadow of death. '
    - person: Reaper
      line: 'The baker''s demise, a puzzle waiting to be pieced together. '
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: After witnessing the Baker murder, I came across a photograph that connected
        all the dots. It became evident that every murder was interlinked, forming
        a sinister pattern.
    - person: Reaper
      line: I must now seek the God.
  - lines:
    - person: GOD
      line: Reaper, now that you know all the murders are connected, I'm offering
        you a new door. Can you guess what's behind the door??
    - person: Reaper
      line: The killer.
    - person: GOD
      line: Correct.
    - person: Reaper
      line: I consider asking them why they committed these murders.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: Seems like your time has come at last.
    - person: Killer
      line: What's going on? Who are you?
    - person: Reaper
      line: I'm the one who guides souls to the afterlife. It's time for you to answer
        for your actions.
    - person: Killer
      line: Am I dead? What do you want from me?
    - person: Reaper
      line: It's time to unravel the story behind your actions. Speak, for the truth
        demands to be known.
    - person: Killer
      line: Do you want to know the reasons behind my murders?
    - person: Reaper
      line: Yes, I want to know everything. Start from the beginning.
    - person: Killer
      line: At the art exhibition, I couldn't bear seeing the artist's success. Envy
        consumed me, and I entered his house with the sole intention of destroying
        his creations. But when he arrived, I lost control. There seemed to be no
        other option.
    - person: Killer
      line: Later, I reached out to an old friend, a priest, with a letter, seeking
        redemption. But he humiliated me. It drove me further into madness, and I
        committed another regretful act. I felt miserable.
    - person: Killer
      line: It was all my father's fault. He never loved me. I went to the bakery
        to confront him, but as usual, he despised me. He claimed he didn't tear
        up my photo, but I didn't believe him.
    - person: Killer
      line: When he saw me crying, he insulted me, said I was acting like a child,
        and so on. I had had enough.
    - person: Killer
      line: Before I knew it, I noticed a cracked spatula in my hand and found him
        lying on the floor. And that's where I am now.
    - person: Reaper
      line: Your tale is one of tragedy and regret. The consequences of your actions
        weigh heavy on your soul. It's time to face judgment and seek redemption.
  - lines:
    - person: Reaper
      line: Seems like your time has come at last.
